🗨️ Real-Time Chat Application

A modern real-time chat application built using WebSockets for instant bi-directional communication between users. This project demonstrates live message updates without page reloads, seamless user interaction, and efficient event-driven communication.

🚀 Features: 

💬 Instant Messaging: Real-time chat powered by WebSockets

👥 Multiple Users: Supports multiple clients connected simultaneously

📡 Live Updates: Messages appear instantly across all connected clients

🔒 User Sessions: Simple username-based login system

🎨 Responsive UI: Built with modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React/Vue/Bootstrap/Tailwind)

🧠 Lightweight Backend: Efficient WebSocket server handling multiple connections

🛠️ Tech Stack: 

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or your framework: React/Vue/Angular)

Backend: Node.js with WebSocket (ws/socket.io)

Communication Protocol: WebSocket

Styling: Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap

⚙️ How It Works

1. The client connects to the server using a WebSocket connection.

2. When a user sends a message, it’s broadcast to all connected clients in real-time.

3. The frontend dynamically updates the chat window without reloading the page.
